# CreateTableScriptFromExcel

The excel can generate 
- table script.
- table comment and column comment.
- constraint script.
- primary key and foreign key.

This first version only for oracle. 

We borrow the idea from [here](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/1050/simple-way-to-create-tables-in-sql-server-using-excel/) .
